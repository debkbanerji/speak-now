                <h3><em>Speak Now</em> is a social network which is centered around sound rather than text</h3>
                <p>You can record and share short snippets of yourself speaking, or singing, if that's more your
                    style.<br>
                    If you're less musically inclined or not a fan of talking you can also just share Spotify links
